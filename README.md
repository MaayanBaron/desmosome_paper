# Desmosome Paper (Baron et al., 2023)
All analysis for the desmosome paper are here

Notebooks available:
1. desmosome_freq_across_cancers_TCGA - notebook containing analysis to plot the frequency of desmosome genes across cancer types in the TCGA cohort. This script requires a folder with maf files for each cohort and mutsigCV outputs (provided in a seprate folder - MutSigCV_outputs/)
2. DSPsiRNA_analysis - notebook containing analysis and plots related to the functional work with DSP siRNA
3. ST_analysis - notebook containing analysis and plots related to the spatial transcriptomics work
4. dndscv_analysis - notebook ontaining analysis to plot the dn/ds ratio results from outputs provided in a seprate folder (dnds_data)

Python scripts available:
1. permutation_ana.py - Methodology for calculating p-values from MutSigCV outputs for a given list of genes. 
    This script utilizes the outputs generated by MutSigCV to compute p-values for a specified list of genes. The methodology involves comparing the observed mutational counts for these genes with the expected counts derived from MutSigCV predictions. By performing this comparison        and applying appropriate statistical tests, the script determines the significance of the observed mutational patterns in the context of the MutSigCV results.
